# GREEN-strategy
The fundamental code of a multi-UAV energy efficiency optimization strategy is shown in this project. In the simulation experiment, we consider a multi-UAV communication system composed of 4 UAVs and 4 GTs. Because of the noconvex issue, we employ SCA technology to iteratively jointly optimize the initial trajectory of multiple UAVs to achieve an optimal energy-efficient trajectory design scheme.
Specially, we provide reference codes for UAV speed optimization, UAV path initialization, multi-UAV hover locations selection, and multi-UAV trajectory optimization with SCA.
